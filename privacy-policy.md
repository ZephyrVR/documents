Privacy Policy
==============

*Revised May 24, 2017.*

This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use of our services, including those offered through our website and first party applications (collectively, the "Service"). When you use the Service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use
### Accounts
Zephyr accounts utilize [Steam's OpenID provider](https://steamcommunity.com/dev) as a means of identity and authentication. The following is collected from Steam:

* Steam username
* Steam user identifier
* Steam avatar URL

Zephyr applications have access to a user account's Steam username and avatar URL upon approval from the user.

### Notification Data
Zephyr's primary service is to act as a notification transport layer. As such, Zephyr may access and transmit the following information regarding notifications:

* Notification title
* Notification body
* Notification icon
* Application which sent the notification
* Device which sent the notification

This information is securely transmitted to approved and connected applications. This information is never stored.

### Anonymous Usage Data
To improve the Service, additional usage information may be collected by third party tools such as Firebase Analytics and Fabric. Such information is gathered anonymously and may tagged with a unique identifier that is generated upon a fresh install. This unique identifier is never connected to a particular Zephyr account. If available, usage data collection and reporting can be disabled via the appropriate setting.

Such information is gathered and stored in accordinance with each service's respective Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

## Security
The security of all information gathered is extremely important, thus steps have been taken to ensure that all transmitted and stored information is secured using best practices.

## Links to Other Sites
This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we shall immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
